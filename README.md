# Gift-Dash

My entry for Krampus Hack 2024, a game jam hosted by https://tins.amarillion.org/

# Secret Santa

I'm the Secret Santa for Bugsquasher.

# Recipient wishlist

1. White Christmas, make it snow

2. Cut scenes / screen transitions between areas/menus

3. Candy, cookies, presents, anything Christmas themed

4. Optional Christmas carols / songs / music / etc

# Gameplay

Collect the presents and candies before the time is up.

Each collected present and candy is giving more time.

Avoid collecting the bad surprises sent by Krampus. They will lower the time you have.

To collect a present or a candy, or a bad surprise, you just have to touch it with your sledge.
