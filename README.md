My entry for Krampus Hack 2024: https://tins.amarillion.org/krampu24/

A game jam hosted by https://tins.amarillion.org/

# Secret Santa

I'm the Secret Santa for Bugsquasher.

# Recipient wishlist

1. White Christmas, make it snow

2. Cut scenes / screen transitions between areas/menus

3. Candy, cookies, presents, anything Christmas themed

4. Optional Christmas carols / songs / music / etc

# Gameplay

Collect the presents and candies before the time is up.

Each present have to be collected in the right order. Follow the green arrow on top of your sledge.

Each collected present is giving more time.

Avoid hitting the bad surprises sent by Krampus. They will slow you down.

To collect a present or a candy, or suffer bad surprise, you just have to touch it with your sledge.
